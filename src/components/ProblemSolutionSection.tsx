Then she waited 3 days for their availability. In the end, she saw only 2 homes, felt rushed, and was nudged toward writing offers she wasn't ready for. When she emailed with follow-up questions? Crickets.",

        story: "Sarah opened FirstLook on Friday. She picked 4 homes, booked tours in under 10 minutes, and visited all of them on her schedule the next day. Each tour was hosted by a vetted local pro‚Äîno pressure, just answers. When she finally found \"the one,\" then she chose to connect with an agent she liked.",

        story: "Mike thought working with a buyer's agent was free. But at closing, he realized the seller paid 3% in commission to the buyer's agent‚Äîbaked into the sale price. That meant on his $300K condo, $9,000 went to an agent he barely interacted with. He never negotiated the fee, never approved the terms‚Äîand never got a breakdown of where that money went.",
