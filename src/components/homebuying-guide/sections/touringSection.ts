    overview: "Seeing homes in person is where the process really gets exciting – and it's an area where FirstLook truly shines. Traditionally, a buyer's agent schedules tours, holds your hand through each house, and offers opinions. Without an agent, you'll be arranging visits yourself, but that doesn't mean you have to go it completely alone.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Schedule tours directly with listing agents or use FirstLook's instant booking",
      "Attend open houses for low-pressure exploration without appointments",
      "Maintain proper touring etiquette and safety practices",
      "Enjoy privacy and freedom to discuss openly without agent pressure"

      "Scheduling Tours Directly: If you find a house you want to see, you have a couple of options. One is to contact the listing agent or seller directly (if it's a For-Sale-By-Owner) to request a showing. Listing agents' info is usually on the listing page. Let them know you're a serious buyer not working with a buyer's agent. They'll typically be happy to set up a time (after all, you potentially save them from having to pay out half the commission). The other option – and a super convenient one – is to use FirstLook's instant tour booking. FirstLook allows you to pick a date and time online for a home viewing, and they dispatch one of their licensed DC pros to meet you there and facilitate the tour. It's like scheduling an Uber, but for house tours!",
      "FirstLook offers a modern, on-demand touring experience: no binding contracts, same-day scheduling, and licensed local professionals to assist – giving you the freedom to see homes on your terms. This means you don't have to play phone tag with a listing agent or worry about saying the wrong thing – FirstLook handles the coordination for you.",
      "Attending Open Houses: Don't forget the classic open house. These are typically held on weekends for listed properties. You can walk in without any appointment. Just sign in and feel free to explore. If an agent asks you if you're represented, simply say you're browsing on your own (or you can mention you're working with FirstLook – they'll understand that as you being an independent buyer). Open houses are a great, low-pressure way to see multiple homes in a day. Bring a friend along if you want a second opinion or just moral support. One perk of not having your own agent at an open house is you can blend in and listen to other buyers' reactions and questions, which can be insightful.",
      "Touring Etiquette and Safety: When touring without an agent, you're essentially your own agent in the field. Be respectful of the properties – arrive on time, take off shoes if asked, don't go snooping in off-limits areas like locked closets or drawers. Feel free to take photos or videos (with permission if the owner is present) so you can review them later. It's a good idea to prepare a checklist for each tour: note your impressions of the layout, condition, neighborhood vibe, etc., and jot down any questions. Always keep safety in mind too: it's rare, but if you're meeting a stranger for a FSBO showing, let someone know where you'll be. With FirstLook, you'll have a vetted professional with you, adding a layer of comfort and security.",
      "Privacy and Freedom: One thing many FirstLook users love is the privacy and freedom of touring without feeling like someone is trying to \"sell\" them. You can discuss openly with your partner or friend on the tour about what you like or don't like, without worrying about swaying an agent's strategy. Some buyers feel more at ease examining the nitty-gritty (like opening cabinets, testing the water pressure) when they're not being closely watched by their own agent. The key is, it's your choice. FirstLook's role is simply to grant you access and answer questions – no hard sales pitch.",
      "How FirstLook Makes Touring Easy: This is one of FirstLook's hallmark features – instant tour bookings and on-demand agents. Unlike a traditional agent who might say \"I'm only free on Friday at 3 PM to show you houses,\" FirstLook has a network of local agents ready to go when you are. Want to see a new listing today at lunch? Just hop on the app/website, select a time, and chances are you'll get a confirmed tour often within minutes. The first tour is free, and thereafter you pay a modest flat fee per tour (which is often credited back to you if you end up purchasing with FirstLook's help). This approach means you can tour more homes, more conveniently – a huge plus in competitive markets where timing is everything."
