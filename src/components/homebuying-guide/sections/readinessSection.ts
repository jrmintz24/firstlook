    overview: "The first step in any homebuying journey is figuring out what you want and what you can afford. Traditionally, a buyer's agent would ask you a bunch of questions to nail down your wish list and budget. But you absolutely can (and should) do this yourself – after all, you know your situation best!",
    keyPoints: [
      "Define your home requirements with must-haves vs. nice-to-haves",
      "Assess your financial readiness including down payment and closing costs",
      "Research mortgage options and local assistance programs",
      "Create a focused strategy to avoid wasting time on unsuitable properties"
    ],

      "Define Your Home Requirements: Make a list of your must-haves and nice-to-haves. How many bedrooms and bathrooms? Do you need a home office or parking spot? Are you set on a specific neighborhood or school district? Get specific about your priorities. This will focus your search so you don't waste time touring homes that aren't a fit. It may help to rank your priorities in order (for example: location, then price, then size, etc.). Remember, without an agent filtering listings for you, it's extra important to have a clear vision of what you're looking for.",
      "Assess Your Financial Readiness: Take a hard look at your finances to understand what price range is realistic. This means reviewing your savings, income, debts, and credit score. In general, you'll want money saved for a down payment (anywhere from ~3% for some first-time buyer programs up to 20% to avoid mortgage insurance) plus about 2–5% of the home price for closing costs and reserves. Use an online home affordability calculator to ballpark what price range and monthly payment you can comfortably handle.",
      "Check Your Mortgage Options: Start researching mortgage rates and loan programs. This isn't about getting a loan just yet – it's about educating yourself on what's available. Look into different loan types (conventional, FHA, VA, etc.), current interest rates, and any first-time homebuyer assistance programs in your area. For example, DC has programs like DC Open Doors and HPAP that can help with down payments if you qualify. Knowing the basics will empower you when it's time to talk to lenders for real.",
      "By clarifying your needs and financial parameters upfront, you set the foundation for a focused, efficient home search. You're essentially acting as your own agent in this stage – defining the criteria that an agent would normally gather from you. Keep your notes handy (consider a simple spreadsheet or note-taking app) and update them as your thinking evolves.",
      "How FirstLook Helps: FirstLook provides tools and templates to help you self-assess your needs. For instance, the platform might prompt you to create a profile with your desired neighborhoods, price range, and home features. This way, when you start searching, FirstLook (or any home search site) can alert you to matching properties. While a traditional agent might quiz you in person, FirstLook lets you thoughtfully consider your priorities on your own, then refine them as you learn more. And when it comes to finances, FirstLook can refer you to trusted mortgage advisors who understand the needs of independent buyers."
