          traditional: "\"Free\" to the buyer in theory, but seller pays ~3% to your agent (built into price). On a $500,000 home that's ~$15,000 in commission, ultimately costing you via a higher price."

          firstlook: "Find homes on your own schedule using online tools (Zillow, Redfin, etc.) or FirstLook's platform. You decide what to see – no middleman gatekeeping listings.",
          traditional: "Agent sets up searches (via MLS) and sends you listings they think fit. You rely on their selections and schedule."

          firstlook: "Book home tours instantly on your timeline. FirstLook provides on-demand, licensed local pros to unlock doors and guide you as needed – but only when you request it. Your first tour is free, with no hidden fees.",
          traditional: "Agent must coordinate showings, and you work around their schedule. You're typically tied to one agent by a contract, and their availability can limit when (and how many) homes you see."
        },
        {
          category: "Negotiation & Offers",
          firstlook: "You stay in control. FirstLook offers resources and expert help (like contract templates or on-call negotiators) only when you need it. You can negotiate directly with sellers or their agents, cutting out the \"telephone game\" for faster communication.",
          traditional: "Agent guides your offer strategy, handles contract drafting, and negotiates with the seller's agent on your behalf. Their commission incentive can subtly conflict (a higher sale price means a bigger commission)."
        },
        {
          category: "Flexibility & Control",
          firstlook: "Maximum control. You decide which homes to see and when, which professionals to consult, and how to approach offers. No pressure to rush into a purchase – FirstLook doesn't get a big commission, so their only goal is your satisfaction.",
          traditional: "Guidance-driven. Agents often steer the process – selecting homes, timing tours, suggesting offer terms. You typically sign an exclusive agreement, limiting your flexibility to try different approaches."
        },
        {
          category: "Professional Network",
          firstlook: "FirstLook connects you to vetted third parties when needed: lenders, home inspectors, real estate attorneys, title companies, etc. You get the benefit of an agent's network without committing to full agent services.",
          traditional: "Agents usually provide referrals for lenders, inspectors, attorneys, and so on – which is helpful, but you might feel obliged to use their contacts. In some cases, choices may be limited to their partners."
