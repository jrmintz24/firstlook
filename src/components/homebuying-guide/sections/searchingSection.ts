    overview: "House-hunting is the fun part! In the old days, agents had exclusive access to the best home listings through the MLS (Multiple Listing Service). Today, however, the internet has leveled the playing field – almost all listings are available online to consumers in real time.",

      "Leverage Online Listing Platforms: Start with popular sites and apps like Zillow, Redfin, Trulia, or Realtor.com to browse homes in your target area. You can filter by price, size, location, features, etc. and even set up email alerts for new listings that meet your criteria. Many Millennial buyers actually find the home they end up purchasing through their own online searches, not their agent. Create a dedicated email for home search inquiries – it keeps your main inbox uncluttered and ensures you don't miss alerts. Keep an eye out for new listings daily; in a hot market, good homes can go under contract fast.",
      "Use FirstLook's Home Search Tools: If you're in DC, FirstLook's platform may offer a curated search experience tied into the local MLS data. FirstLook can aggregate listings and provide additional context, like neighborhood stats or commute times, to help you evaluate options. At the very least, FirstLook will allow you to save favorite properties and seamlessly request a tour with one click. Essentially, it combines the browsing power of the big sites with the convenience of an on-demand tour scheduler.",
      "Explore Neighborhoods in Person (and Virtually): Without an agent chauffeuring you to showings, you'll want to become your own neighborhood expert. Drive or walk through areas you're interested in – this gives you a feel for the community that photos can't. Note things like nearby shops, traffic levels, and general upkeep of the area. You can also use Google Street View to virtually \"walk\" the neighborhood. Some buyers even reach out on local forums or social media (e.g. neighborhood Facebook groups or Nextdoor) to ask residents about the area. Remember, an agent often can't tell you subjective things like \"Is this a family-friendly block?\" due to fair housing laws, but as an independent buyer you can do that legwork yourself.",
      "Keep a Comparison Sheet: It's easy to get listing overload when you're searching solo. Consider keeping a simple spreadsheet or notebook to track the homes you like. List addresses, key pros/cons, and questions that arise (e.g., \"House on 14th St – great kitchen, but what's the parking situation?\"). This helps you stay organized. An agent would normally help remind you of a property's details, but your notes can do the same. FirstLook might also keep a history of homes you've viewed or toured on your account, which is handy for reference.",
      "One thing to be aware of: off-market listings and coming soons. Traditional agents sometimes know about homes not yet publicly listed. While you might miss a few of those by not having an agent's insider scoop, many \"coming soon\" homes still find their way to Zillow or local real estate Facebook groups. If you're worried about missing out, you can network a bit – attend open houses (talk to the listing agents), join local real estate meetup groups, or have FirstLook notify you of any exclusive listings they know about. But realistically, the vast majority of buyers find their home through public listings.",
      "How FirstLook Supports Your Search: FirstLook is all about a transparent home search. The platform doesn't push certain listings on you to meet a quota or commission target. Instead, you can use it to bookmark homes you love and get honest, data-driven insights. For example, FirstLook might show you how long a property has been on the market or if there were recent price drops. Also, FirstLook can flag which homes might offer better deals if there's no buyer's agent commission involved. Some sellers may be open to discounting the price if you come without an agent, since it saves them paying the buyer's agent – FirstLook can help identify those opportunities."
