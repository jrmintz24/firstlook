    problem: "Traditional agents pressure you into exclusive buyer agreements before showing a single home, trapping you with someone you may not want to work with",

    problem: "You're stuck with weekend-only open houses on the seller's schedule, fighting crowds and getting rushed through properties you're serious about",
    solution: "Schedule private showings 7 days a week at times that work for YOUR schedule - evenings, mornings, or weekends with undivided attention"

    problem: "Agents often show you homes that benefit their commission rather than your needs, and you have no way to know their true motivations",
    solution: "Your showing partner has no hidden agenda - they're paid fairly regardless of which home you choose, so their focus is entirely on helping you find the right fit"

    problem: "The new NAR rules create confusion about who pays what and when, leaving buyers uncertain about costs until it's too late to back out",
    solution: "Complete transparency from day one: first showing is free, additional services have clear flat-rate pricing with no surprise fees or commission splits"
